<h3 align="center">Civic Builder: AI-Powered Urban 3D Modelling Solution</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Civic Builder is a procedural city and terrain modeling tool that uses computer vision techniques to automatically extract features such as buildings, roads, forests, and rivers from satellite imagery and generate large amounts of 3D models. It is inteded for use in flight training simulation, but may also be used for games development and architectural visualization, as well as digital twin applications.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

A common issue I've run accross during my placement year as a software developer was the very tedious manual process to create large amounts of 3D content that would never be seen from close up. Hours spent manually clicking on satellite imagery to create simplified polygons that any half-decent building detection algorithm could figure out. Such a task should have been first priority for automation, I thought. And Civic Builder is my attempt at presenting such a solution to the world.

Issues Identified with Existing Methods:
* Manual modelling of low-fidelity requiment models is a waste of resources and produces the same result as a building detection model in the best case scenario, and more often gets it wrong.
* Generalization to different geographic regions.
* 


Solutions:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
