### Overview
Civic Builder is a procedural city and terrain modeling tool that uses computer vision techniques to automatically extract features such as buildings, roads, forests, and rivers from datasets. 

It generates realistic 3D cities and geographical features, integrating with Blender Geometry Nodes and Unreal Engine 5 for real-time rendering and simulation. This project leverages Python and C#, employing datasets from Kaggle and OpenStreetMap.
